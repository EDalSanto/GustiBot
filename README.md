# GustiLogistics

Welcome to my *small business supply chain management web app*, custom built for my former company, [Gustiamo](https://www.gustiamo.com/). Although I'm continuing to refactor and add features, they have already begun to derive value use it weekly. In short, this application helps them to manage their supply chain more efficiently and effectively via:
* Inventory and Customer Data Analytics / Visualizations
* Forecasting of Inventory Reorder Dates and Quantities

### Tech Stack

* Ruby on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) application hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and backed by [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
  * Makes particular use of the following [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):
    * [Roo](https://github.com/roo-rb/roo) for parsing Excel spreadsheets.
    * [Bootstrap-Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/) for styling on the Front-End.
    * [jQuery](https://rubygems.org/gems/jquery-rails) for making [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) requests.
    * [Chartkick](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick) for Data Visualizations.

### Application Features

The app requires authentication to access, so below is a recap of the main sections. 

Upon login the app displays:
* An indexing of all products', along with their current quantities and reorder by dates. 

Note: Not all suppliers and products have been uploaded yet.

Two **spreadsheet uploaders** can be seen at the bottom-left of the above page which:
* Are parsed as an argument in the [params hash](https://gorails.com/episodes/the-params-hash). 
* Enable updates of the database on the client's end.

The Calendar link in the top navbar leads to a **calendar page**, which takes inspiration from this [RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/213-calendars). This calendar:
* Displays which products should be reordered based on calculated reorder dates. 
* Provides a context of time, which helps my former company envision the bigger picture of ordering, as they need to group orders from different vendors in one vessel from Italy.

Clicking on a product link on the calendar page takes you to a **product analysis page** which:
* Lists all vital stats, such as reorder dates and quantities.
* Displays Top B2B customers and total B2C(retail) sales in a table and pie chart. 
* Ranks customers in the last 12 months in 6-month halves, as requested by the client.
* Enables shipping status and reorder by date of product to be toggled with top button.

My **vision** for this application is that it will:
* Handle all matters related to supply chain management, such as reorder calculations, and customer, product, and supplier analyses / visualizations. 
* Generalize to more services, such as company communication and project management. 
* Become useful for other small "brick and mortar" businesses.
