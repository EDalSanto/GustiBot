# GustiLogistics

Rails App that enables my former company [Gustiamo](https://www.gustiamo.com) to manage their supply chain more efficiently via custom Data Analytics, Visualization and Forecasting tools. In short, my app creates visuals for each product's sales by top customers and uses this data to predict future reordering dates and quantities, both of which are rendered on a calendar. 

* Makes particular use of the following JS and Ruby libraries:
  * [JS Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts) for Data Visualization of top customers and sales.
  * [Roo](https://github.com/roo-rb/roo) for parsing Excel spreadsheets downloaded from Inventory Management system.
